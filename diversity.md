# Diversity equity and inclusion statement

Neuroconductor is a small team, primarily Dr. John Muschelli and Adrian Gherman as platform developers. 
Faculty members Dr. Ciprian Crainiceanu and Dr. Brian Caffo offer administrative and executive support. The
lack of diversity in the core team can be contrasted with a diverse collection of developers and users and
the Neuroconductor commuity. Neuroconductor owes much of its success and growth to this diverse community. 

It is our hope to increase diversity among the core team  in subsequent hires of dedicated platform devlepors, 
technical support, and student involvement, as the platform grows beyond its two founders. All new hires will 
adhere to Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg School of Public Health diversity and inclusion requirements. 
The Johns Hopkins equal opportunity statement is as follows:

*Johns Hopkins University is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of gender, 
marital status, pregnancy, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, 
gender identity or expression, veteran status, other legally protected characteristics or any other occupationally 
irrelevant criteria. The University promotes Affirmative Action for minorities, women, individuals who are disabled, 
and veterans. Johns Hopkins University is a drug-free, smoke-free workplace*

Current student involvement lies primarily in package development for neuroimaging research performed in the 
Biostatistics deaprtment for students and post doctoral fellows working with Dr. Mushelli, Dr. Crainiceanu and
Dr. Caffo. The Department of Biostatistics can boast a diverse cohort along many dimensions (race, ethnicity,
gender, country of origin, ...) in its students and post doctoral ranks. Student recruitment to the department
several layers of administrative oversight to ensure fair and inclusive processes. Postdoctoral searches follow
University rules on diversity and inclusion.

Neuroconductor has recently adopted a code of conduct, which can be found on its website.


# Neuroconductor Statement on Diversity and Inclusion

Neuroconductor is committed to a diverse, friendly, inclusive environment for its platform developers, package developers,
users and community. Our community operates on the principles of mutual respect, tolerance and inclusion. We welcome any
and all interested in computational imaging to be involved in the Neuroconductor project. We strive to have a supportive, 
constructive and productive environment.

# Summary

The goal of Neuroconductor is to use computational imaging for the bettterment of society. Our hope is to be a part of
lessening the burden of disease, understanding biological mechanisms and helping patients with better diagnoses. We hope that 
these  lofty ideals continue to inspire the sort of supportive and inclusive community that it has so far. We hope that this
initiative, if funded, we create greater and even more positive community engagement in the project.
